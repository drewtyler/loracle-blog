If you're reading this, you probably already have a system.

Maybe it's Obsidian with a sprawling vault of linked notes. Maybe it's Notion with databases for NPCs, locations, and quests. Maybe it's World Anvil, or a physical notebook with color-coded tabs, or a Google Doc that's gotten out of control.

You care about your campaign. You put in the work. You take notes.

**This post is for you.**

## The gap between prep and play

Your system captures what you build. The worldbuilding. The NPC backstories. The dungeon maps and faction politics. That's your canvas—where you paint the world before the session.

But what happens *during* the session?

Players ask unexpected questions. You invent answers. A shopkeeper gets a name, a personality, a secret. A location gets described in ways you never wrote down. Relationships form. Promises are made. Plot threads spawn from throwaway lines.

Some of this makes it into your notes. After the session, if you remember, if you have time.

Most of it doesn't.

## The 80% problem

Here's a rough estimate: you probably capture 20% of what happens at the table.

The other 80%—the improv, the details, the emergent story—lives only in memory. And memory is unreliable. It fades. It distorts. It conflates session 15 with session 22.

Your notebook is full of what you *planned*. It's missing what *happened*.

## A camera for the table

Loracle isn't trying to replace your notebook. We're not another place to take notes.

We're the camera.

Record your session. We transcribe it, extract the entities—every character, location, item, and quest mentioned. Then we make it searchable.

Your notebook stays your notebook. Your system stays your system. But now you have a source of truth for what actually happened at the table.

When you're updating your Obsidian vault after a session, you don't have to rely on memory. Search Loracle: "What did we name the blacksmith?" "What was the prophecy wording?" "Who did the rogue promise to help?"

Sourced answers. Copy them into your notes. Your canvas gets richer.

## The workflow

Here's how it fits:

1. **Before session**: Prep in your tool of choice. Build the world.
2. **During session**: Focus on running the game. Loracle records.
3. **After session**: Search Loracle for what happened. Update your notes with real information, not guesses.

No new system to learn. No migration. Just a layer that catches what you'd otherwise lose.

## For the note-takers

You're already doing the hard work. You care enough to build systems, to organize, to remember.

Loracle just makes sure your system has access to everything—not just what you prepped, but what emerged. Not just your plans, but your play.

Your notebook is your canvas.

Let Loracle be your camera.
