There's an unspoken rule in the D&D community: **good DMs take good notes.**

Session logs. NPC lists. Relationship maps. Plot thread trackers. The advice is everywhere—buy a nice notebook, develop a system, write everything down.

And it makes sense. When you're running a campaign that spans months or years, memory fails. Players ask about the shopkeeper from session 12. They want to know what the prophecy actually said. They remember making a deal with someone, but not who.

So you write it all down. Or you try to.

## The problem with notes

Here's what actually happens:

1. You run an incredible session. The players go off-script. An NPC you invented on the spot becomes their favorite character. Someone makes a promise that will matter later.

2. The session ends. Everyone's tired but happy. You clean up, maybe have a drink, decompress.

3. You think: "I should write this down."

4. You don't. Or you write half of it. Or you write it but forget the important part.

5. Three sessions later: "Wait, what was that guy's name?"

The notes you take are filtered through exhaustion, through what you *thought* was important, through the limits of memory. They're incomplete by definition.

**Your notes are what you remembered to write. Not what happened.**

## A different philosophy

What if the expectation is wrong?

What if you shouldn't have to take notes?

Your brain is for storytelling—for voices, for drama, for thinking on your feet when the players do something unexpected. That's the hard part. That's the art.

Why should you also be the stenographer?

## The camera, not the canvas

Think about it this way: you're creating something at the table. A living, improvised story. Your notebook is your canvas—where you build your world, prep your encounters, sketch your ideas.

But the session itself? That's a live performance. And live performances need a camera, not a canvas.

Something that captures what actually happened. The NPC name you invented. The promise the rogue made. The plot twist that emerged from chaos.

Not what you planned. What happened.

## Loracle's bet

This is why we built Loracle.

Record your session. We'll transcribe it, extract the characters, locations, quests, and items. We'll remember what you forgot to write down.

Then, when you need it: ask. "What did the oracle say about the sword?" "Who was that merchant in Waterdeep?" "What did we promise the dragon?"

Sourced answers. In seconds.

Your brain stays free. For the next voice. The next twist. The next moment of magic at the table.

**Because you shouldn't have to take notes.**
