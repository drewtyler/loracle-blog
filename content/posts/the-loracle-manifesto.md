Somewhere in my campaign is a promise I made and forgot. My players haven't.

I don't know what it was. I don't know who it was to. I don't know when they'll call it in. But I know it's there—buried somewhere in the hundred-plus hours we've spent at the table together, waiting.

Maybe it was something an NPC said in the heat of the moment. Maybe it was a throwaway line that landed harder than I expected. Maybe it was a deal struck in a tavern, a vow made in a dungeon, a whispered secret that meant nothing to me and everything to them.

They remember. I don't.

And someday, they're going to look at me expectantly, waiting for me to deliver on something I have no memory of promising.

This is the fear that lives in the back of every Dungeon Master's mind.

## The weight of a living world

When you run a tabletop campaign, you're not writing a novel. You're not directing a film. You're doing something much stranger: you're improvising a story in real-time with a group of people who have their own ideas, their own agendas, their own memories of what you've said.

Every session, you speak thousands of words. You invent characters on the spot. You describe locations you've never seen before. You make rulings, drop hints, plant seeds. You respond to questions you didn't anticipate with answers you won't remember giving.

And all of it matters. Not to you—not in the moment—but to *them*. To your players, who are building a mental model of your world based on every word you say. Who are forming attachments to NPCs you invented to fill thirty seconds of dialogue. Who are theorizing about prophecies you ad-libbed at midnight when your brain was running on fumes.

A novelist can revise. A screenwriter can edit. You can't. The words leave your mouth and become canon instantly, irrevocably. Your players heard them. They wrote them down. They're going to hold you to them.

The world you're building isn't in your notes. It's in the air between you and your players. It's in the session itself—the living, breathing, ephemeral thing that disappears the moment you pack up the dice.

Your notes are what you *planned*. The session is what *happened*. And they're never the same.

## The slow forgetting

I've been running games for over a decade. I've tried everything.

I've kept detailed session logs—twenty pages of notes that I never read again because who has time to reread twenty pages before every session. I've used wikis, databases, Obsidian vaults with hundreds of linked entries. I've bought fancy notebooks with index tabs and color-coded sections. I've delegated note-taking to players. I've recorded sessions and told myself I'd listen back later.

I never listened back. Nobody listens back. Four hours of audio to find a single detail? The economics don't work.

And still, the forgetting happens. It always happens.

Not the big things. I remember the big things—the dragon fight, the character death, the twist that made everyone gasp. Those moments burn themselves into memory. They become the stories we tell about our campaigns years later.

It's the small things that slip away. The name of the innkeeper in the town they loved. The exact wording of the curse. The backstory detail a player mentioned once that I promised would come back. The half-formed plot thread I dangled and then lost in the chaos of everything else.

The small things are where the magic lives. The small things are what make a campaign feel *real*—like a world that exists beyond the edges of the spotlight, full of people and places and consequences that persist whether you're looking at them or not.

When you forget the small things, the world gets thinner. The NPCs become interchangeable. The locations blur together. The sense that actions have consequences starts to fade, because consequences require memory, and memory is failing.

I was losing them. Constantly. Silently. One forgotten detail at a time.

## The breaking point

The moment I knew something had to change came about two years into a campaign.

We were deep into the story—past the point where you can easily retcon, past the point where the players have built complex mental models of how everything connects. This was a campaign where the players had notebooks of their own. Where they tracked NPCs and relationships and debts. Where they cared about continuity because I'd taught them to care.

One of my players—let's call her Sarah—asked about an NPC. Someone they'd met early on, someone who'd given them a warning about something. She wanted to know if the warning had come true. She wanted to know if they should have listened.

I had no idea who she was talking about.

I didn't recognize the name. I didn't remember the scene. I couldn't even fake it, because Sarah was asking specific questions about specific things this character had supposedly said. She had notes. She had quotes.

I had nothing.

I had to admit it. "I don't remember."

The table went quiet. Not angry—my players are kind—but something shifted. I could see it in their faces. The spell broke, just a little. The world stopped being a place that existed and started being a thing I was making up. The difference matters more than I can express.

That night, after everyone left, I sat with my notes. Hundreds of pages. Cross-referenced. Color-coded. The kind of prep that looks impressive on /r/DMAcademy. And I couldn't find Sarah's NPC anywhere.

Because I'd never written them down. Because they were improvised. Because the thing my player remembered most vividly from months of play was the thing I'd put the least thought into.

Here's what haunts me: I still don't know what I said. I don't know what I promised. Sarah's character made decisions based on that NPC's warning. The whole party did. And I have no idea what warning they were responding to.

I improvised my way through the next few sessions. Made up something that could have been the prophecy. It probably wasn't what I originally said, but it was close enough that nobody called me on it. The campaign survived.

But I knew: I got lucky. And I couldn't keep getting lucky forever.

## The tools that almost worked

After that night, I became obsessed with solving this problem.

I tried everything on the market. I gave each tool a real chance—months of use, honest effort, genuine hope that this would be the one.

**Obsidian** was beautiful. I built an elaborate vault with templates and tags and linked references. The graph view made me feel like a genius. But the vault only contained what I put into it, and I kept putting things in wrong. I'd write "the blacksmith" when the players remembered "Garrett the blacksmith," and suddenly my search was useless. The tool was only as good as my exhausted post-session memory.

**World Anvil** was comprehensive. Every field you could want, every relationship you could track. But it was built for worldbuilding, not for capturing play. It was magnificent for describing the city I'd prepped. It had nothing to say about what happened when the players burned it down.

**Notion** was flexible. I could build anything. So I built systems, and then I built better systems, and then I rebuilt everything from scratch because the old system wasn't working. I spent more time maintaining my Notion than running my campaign. The tool had become the game, and I wasn't even having fun.

**Recording** seemed like the obvious answer. Just capture everything, right? I bought a good microphone. I recorded every session. And then I had hundreds of hours of audio that I never once listened to. The information was there—technically—but it was locked inside a format that made it impossible to access. Finding a specific detail meant listening to hours of crosstalk and combat and jokes. Nobody does that.

The pattern became clear: every tool either required me to do the work (and I was the bottleneck) or captured the wrong thing (prep instead of play) or captured the right thing in an unusable format (raw audio).

I needed something that captured what actually happened at the table and made it searchable without requiring any work from me.

Nothing like that existed.

So I started building it.

## The gap

Before I talk about building Loracle, I need to explain the problem more precisely. Because once you see it, you can't unsee it.

**Your prep and your play are two different things.**

Your notes describe the world you imagine. Your sessions create the world your players experience. And there's a gap between them—a gap that grows wider every time you improvise, every time you say something unplanned, every time the story goes somewhere you didn't expect.

In a typical session, maybe 30% of what happens is prepped. The rest is improvised. Riffed. Made up on the spot. And that 70% is usually the best stuff—the moments of genuine surprise, the characters who emerge from nothing, the plot twists you discover alongside your players.

But prep gets preserved. Improv gets forgotten.

Your notes remember the dungeon you designed. They don't remember what the players actually did in it. Your wiki has the NPC backstory you wrote. It doesn't have the conversation that made your players fall in love with them.

Most tools are designed for prep. They're canvases for worldbuilding. They're where you paint the dungeon before the players kick down the door.

But what happens *after* they kick down the door? What happens when they ignore your dungeon entirely and befriend the monster outside? What happens when the throwaway shopkeeper becomes the most beloved NPC in the campaign?

That's the gap. The prep-play gap. And nothing fills it.

You can try to fill it yourself. You can take notes during the session (and split your attention from the game). You can write summaries after (and trust your exhausted memory to be accurate). You can ask your players to help (and hope they caught the things you missed).

But you're always playing catch-up. You're always reconstructing. You're always working from incomplete information about *your own world*.

The gap isn't a personal failing. It's structural. It's built into the nature of tabletop gaming—a medium where the canonical version of the story exists only in the live performance, and nowhere else.

Until now.

## Building the camera

I started working on Loracle because I wanted to solve this problem for myself.

The idea was simple, even if the execution wasn't: what if you could record your sessions and have AI extract everything that mattered? Not a transcript—nobody wants to read a transcript. But a structured knowledge base: every character mentioned, every location described, every item found, every quest given. Searchable. Browsable. Connected.

Not what you planned. What happened.

I thought of it as the difference between a canvas and a camera. Your notebook is your canvas—where you paint the world before the session. Loracle is your camera—capturing the world as it actually unfolds at the table.

The first version was embarrassingly simple. Speech-to-text, then a prompt asking GPT to "find all the characters." It worked about 40% of the time. But that 40% was enough to prove the concept. I found NPCs I'd forgotten. I found plot threads I'd dropped. I found details I had no memory of inventing.

The second version got serious about extraction. Not just characters, but locations, items, quests, monsters—the full taxonomy of things that matter in a TTRPG. Context for each one: when did it appear, what was said about it, how does it connect to everything else.

I learned that extraction is harder than it sounds. The AI would find "the door" and catalog it as a location. It would split "King Marcus" and "the king" into two different characters. It would miss the prophecy entirely because it was phrased as a question. Every edge case required thought.

The third version added search. Not just browsing entities, but asking questions. "What did the oracle say about the sword?" "Who betrayed us in Waterdeep?" "What did I promise the dragon?" The AI finds the relevant transcript sections, synthesizes an answer, shows its sources.

This is where it started feeling like magic. Asking a question about my own campaign and getting an accurate, sourced answer in seconds—it felt like having a research assistant who'd attended every session and taken perfect notes.

The fourth version is what you can use today. It's not perfect—nothing is ever perfect—but it works. It closes the gap. It makes sure the improvised details are as preserved as the planned ones. It gives you a memory that doesn't forget.

---

## What you actually get

Let me be concrete about what this means in practice.

**You get instant recall.** Someone mentions an NPC from twenty sessions ago. Instead of frantically flipping through notes, you search. "Who is Mira?" Three seconds later: "Mira is a halfling merchant the party met in Thornwood. She sold them the enchanted compass and warned them about the Baron's spies. First appeared in Session 7."

**You get the exact words.** Not what you think you said. Not what you vaguely remember. The actual transcript. "What did the prophecy say?" Here it is, verbatim, with the timestamp if you want to listen.

**You get connections you didn't notice.** The AI sees patterns across sessions. "Mira mentioned the Baron. The Baron was connected to the Thornwood conspiracy. The conspiracy involved the artifact the party found in Session 12." Your improvised details start weaving themselves into coherent threads.

**You get player recaps without the work.** Every session generates a summary. Your players can read what happened last time without you having to write it. Show up to the table ready to play instead of spending 20 minutes recapping.

**You get freedom to improvise.** This is the big one. When you know the details are being captured, you can stop trying to capture them yourself. You can stop the anxious mental note-taking. You can be fully present in the scene, knowing that whatever you invent will be there when you need it.

The best sessions are the ones you couldn't have prepped for. Loracle makes sure those sessions aren't lost.

## What you discover about yourself

There's something I didn't expect.

When you can search your own campaign, you start seeing patterns. Connections you didn't notice. Threads you didn't realize you were weaving. The unconscious storytelling that happens when you improvise over dozens of sessions starts to become visible.

I found foreshadowing I didn't know I planted. I mentioned a burned village in session 3 that became central to the plot in session 30. I didn't plan that. I didn't even remember mentioning it. But there it was, waiting.

I found character arcs I didn't know I was building. An NPC I'd introduced as comic relief had slowly become more serious, more burdened, more complex. The progression was invisible session-to-session, but obvious when I could see the whole history at once.

The campaign becomes legible in a way it never was before—not just to your players, but to you.

You start to understand your own instincts. You notice the themes you return to, the character types you gravitate toward, the story structures that emerge naturally from your improvisations. The campaign becomes a mirror.

You become a better DM. Not because you're working harder, but because you can see your own work clearly for the first time.

---

## For the players, too

I built Loracle for DMs, but I've learned it might matter even more for players.

Think about what it's like to be a player in a long campaign. You show up every week or two. You try to remember where you left off. You have a vague sense of the major plot points, but the details blur together. You're dependent on the DM to remind you what's happening—and the DM is barely holding it together themselves.

You want to engage with the lore, but you can't remember it. You want to reference past events, but you're not sure you have them right. You want to roleplay continuity, but you're faking half of it.

Now imagine being able to search the campaign yourself. "Who was that dwarf we met in the mines?" "What did my character promise the witch?" "What did the letter actually say?"

No more waiting for the DM to find their notes. No more "I think it was something like..." No more faking it when you can't remember.

Players get to engage with the world the way the DM does—with full access to what's happened, full ability to connect the dots, full ownership of the story they're helping to tell.

The campaign stops being something the DM manages and the players consume. It becomes something everyone can explore together.

## Built with care

A word about how we approach this. Because I know what you're thinking.

Your campaign is personal. The stories you tell at the table are intimate—full of inside jokes, vulnerable moments, creative risks, things you'd never want a stranger to hear. The idea of feeding that into an AI system should give you pause.

It gives us pause.

We've built Loracle with that discomfort in mind.

Your audio is processed and discarded. We don't keep recordings longer than we need to transcribe them. Once the entities are extracted, the audio is gone. We have no interest in your raw recordings. We can't sell them, we can't train on them, we can't do anything with them. They're deleted.

Your data is yours. We don't use your campaigns to train our models. We don't share your information with third parties. We don't mine your sessions for insights about "what gamers want." The transaction is simple: you give us audio, we give you a searchable knowledge base. That's it.

We're also careful about what the AI does and doesn't do.

Loracle extracts and organizes. It doesn't invent. It doesn't generate content. It doesn't decide what your world should be or suggest what should happen next. It doesn't write your NPCs or plot your campaigns or create content on your behalf.

We've seen the AI tools that do that. They're impressive. They're also not what we're building.

Loracle is a memory tool, not a creativity tool. The goal is to augment your memory, not replace your imagination. The story is still yours—your voice, your choices, your improvisations. Loracle just makes sure you don't lose them.

## The promise we're keeping

Somewhere in your campaign is a promise you made and forgot.

Maybe it's a prophecy you invented at midnight when you were tired and reaching. Maybe it's a deal you struck with a player who was more invested than you realized. Maybe it's a detail that seemed small at the time but meant everything to someone at your table.

That promise is waiting. Your players remember it, even if you don't. And someday—maybe next session, maybe next year—they're going to expect you to deliver.

Loracle is how you find it before they ask. How you discover the threads you've been weaving without knowing it. How you close the gap between what you planned and what happened.

It's not a replacement for good notes or careful prep or the hard work of running a great campaign. It's a safety net. A backup brain. A guarantee that the small magic—the improvised details, the offhand remarks, the tiny promises—won't slip through the cracks.

It's the campaign memory you don't have to build.

Record your sessions. We'll remember them for you.

And when your players finally ask about that prophecy, that NPC, that promise you made and forgot—you'll have an answer.
