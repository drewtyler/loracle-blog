Ask any DM about their best session ever. The one players still talk about years later.

I'll bet you anything: **it wasn't the one they prepped the most.**

It was the one where everything went sideways. Where the players ignored the dungeon and befriended the monster. Where an NPC invented in desperation became the campaign's heart. Where the story went somewhere no one—including the DM—expected.

The best sessions emerge. They can't be planned.

## The improv paradox

Here's the tension every DM lives with:

You prep because you care. You build the world, design the encounters, write the dialogue. That's craft.

But the *magic*? That happens when you throw it away. When you riff. When the players surprise you and you surprise yourself.

The barbarian adopts the goblin. The wizard makes a deal with the wrong god. The party decides to open a tavern instead of saving the kingdom.

And you roll with it. You invent. You discover the story alongside your players.

These moments are gold. They're also the first thing forgotten.

## The memory gap

Prepped content survives. It's in your notes. The dungeon map, the NPC backstory, the plot outline—you wrote it down *before* the session.

But the improv? The stuff that actually made the session great?

That exists only in the moment. In the memory of everyone at the table. And memory fades.

Three sessions later, someone asks: "What was the name of that goblin the barbarian adopted?"

Silence. Nervous laughter. "I think it started with a G?"

The magic is gone.

## Catching lightning

This is what Loracle is for.

Not to replace your prep. Not to generate your story. But to catch the lightning.

Record the session. Let us listen. We'll find:

- The NPC name you invented at 11 PM when your brain was fried
- The promise made in the heat of roleplay
- The plot twist that emerged from a joke
- The lore you improvised and immediately forgot

All searchable. All sourced. All yours.

So next time someone asks about the goblin, you don't guess. You know. And you can build on it—because nothing was lost.

## Keep riffing

The best DMs aren't the ones who prep the most. They're the ones who can let go—who trust the improv, who play to find out what happens.

Loracle lets you do that without fear.

Riff harder. Go off-script. Let the story emerge.

We'll remember it for you.
